build an APK file and see how it performs on emulator / phone
	it crashes when you load a game with lots of turns and you try to view the suggestionHistoryScreen
	I believe this will be fixed if, instead of using a separate label for every single number, a single label was used for each entire turn
	for now, though, this is not a priority and i'll be moving on to other projects



add picture/icon of each weapon to spinner dropdown
	first see about adding images in general




for guess history: 		(goal is to make it faster to load, and faster to resize)
	use BoxLayout:
		
		padding: 50
		spacing: 20
	can you use padding & spacing with GridLayout?? or whatever? 



player guess history screen
	can make it scrollable and dynamically expanding? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdcUg_rX2fM
	ScrollView widget
